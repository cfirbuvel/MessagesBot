## Notes

1. __Files should be reuploaded for each message, or cached somehow?__

       Telegram file_id strings are bound to the account which generated them. 
       An attempt in using a foreign file id will result in errors such as [400 MEDIA_EMPTY]. 
       The only exception are stickersâ€™ file ids; you can use them across different accounts without any problem.
